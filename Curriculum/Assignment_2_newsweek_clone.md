# Newsweek Clone

For assignment 2, you will be cloning [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/).

The version that you will be cloning is a slightly older version and a demo of the solution can be found [here](http://newsweek-clone.bitballoon.com/).

We have prepared the HTML and CSS files for you with some basic settings, including a simple navbar. Focus on building out the content of the webpage. Your end product should look something similar to pictures below in different screen sizes.
