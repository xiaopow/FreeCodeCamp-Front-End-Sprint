Your project needs to satisfy the following criteria:
* Calculate and display the total price.
* Calculate and display the sub total price of each item.
* Allow user to add a new item.
* Allow user to delete an item.

If you have more time, improve its design. Check out this train station themed shopping cart [example](http://xiao-pow-cart.bitballoon.com/).
